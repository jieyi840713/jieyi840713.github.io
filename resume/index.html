                <p>
                    I am a full-stack engineer with two years of working experience. After gaining a profound understanding of the differences between front-end and back-end development, I started self-learning commonly used back-end programming language (Java) and relevant knowledge. I am capable of providing suggestions before project development and effectively communicating with colleagues, ensuring the successful completion of each project. With a background in accounting, I possess a deep understanding of numerical logic, which greatly contributes to my problem-solving abilities.
